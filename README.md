<strong>Project Title:</strong> Responsive Dashboard with CSS Grid

<strong>Project Overview:</strong>
This project involves creating a fully functional and visually appealing dashboard layout using primarily CSS Grid for the layout. The dashboard includes a sidebar, a header, and a main content area that houses different sections like projects, announcements, and trending items. The goal is to practice advanced CSS Grid techniques while ensuring a clean and organized UI. The design was customized with unique colors, icons, and typography, leveraging assets from resources like Material Design Icons and Google Fonts.

<strong>Technologies and Skills Used:</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML5:</strong> Used to structure the dashboard layout with elements such as sidebar, header, and main content sections.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS3 (Grid Layout):</strong> The primary tool used to manage the overall layout, including nesting grids for different sections.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS Flexbox:</strong> Utilized in specific sections where aligning items horizontally or vertically was more efficient.</li>
  <li><strong>Responsive Design Techniques:</strong> Though responsiveness was optional, breakpoints were added to handle screen resizing for the project cards.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Fonts (Roboto):</strong> Integrated custom fonts using Google Fonts to enhance the design.</li>
  <li><strong>Material Design Icons (SVGs):</strong> Used scalable vector icons for navigation, buttons, and other UI elements.</li>
  <li><strong>Tailwind Color Palettes:</strong> Referenced for selecting complementary color schemes for the dashboard.</li>
  <li><strong>Version Control (Git/GitHub):</strong> Managed project progress and version history using Git. The final project was deployed using GitHub Pages.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Features:</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Grid-Based Layout:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A fully responsive dashboard layout utilizing CSS Grid as the core technique for structuring the sidebar, header, and main content areas.</li>
      <li>Nested grids within major sections (e.g., sidebar, header) for precise placement of elements such as navigation links, branding, search bar, and user info.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sidebar Navigation:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A sticky sidebar with a grid-based structure that organizes navigation links and branding at the top.</li>

      <li>The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring the dashboard remains user-friendly across devices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Deployment and Version Control:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The project was version-controlled through Git and hosted on GitHub Pages, allowing it to be accessed live online.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li><strong>Modular Code Structure:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The project is organized with a clear separation of concerns: application logic (e.g., creating and managing todos) is separated from DOM manipulation and rendering.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
